# Decentralized Ticketing System on ICP Blockchain

This project aims to develop a decentralized ticketing system leveraging the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain. The system aims to provide a transparent, secure, and censorship-resistant alternative to traditional centralized ticketing platforms, while enabling new possibilities for automation, interoperability, and innovation in the ticketing industry.

## Features

- **Transparency and Immutability**: All ticket transactions and event details are recorded on the ICP blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable ledger.
- **Decentralization and Censorship Resistance**: The system is decentralized and not controlled by a single authority, reducing the risk of censorship and single points of failure.
- **Trustless and Secure**: Transactions are secured by cryptography and consensus mechanisms, eliminating the need for intermediaries or trusted third parties.
- **Interoperability**: Tickets and event data can be easily shared and interoperated across different applications and platforms built on the ICP blockchain.
- **Automation and Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts automate various aspects of the ticketing process, such as ticket distribution, resale, and refunds.
- **Scalability**: The ICP blockchain is designed to be scalable, potentially allowing the system to handle high transaction volumes and accommodate large-scale events.

## Getting Started

To get started with the decentralized ticketing system, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies and tools (e.g., Node.js, Rust, ICP SDK).
2. Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/H3nryK/Decentralized-ticketing-system.git
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Decentralized-ticketing-system
4. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
5. Configure the project settings (e.g., blockchain network, smart contract addresses).
6. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
7. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
  to interact with the system.
